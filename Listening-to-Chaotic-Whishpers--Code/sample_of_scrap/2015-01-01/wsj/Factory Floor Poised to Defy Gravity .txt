Factory Floor Poised to Defy Gravity Aside from an affinity for pages full of complicated-looking equations backing up sometimes fantastic assertions, there is this idea of “escape velocity” investors keep hearing about.For Ph.D.s working at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, that refers to the speed at which an object breaks free of Earth’s gravity (about 25,000 miles an hour, by the way).Not surprisingly, there is no agreed-upon speed. That is why there have been a few false alarms since the last downturn ended in June 2009. Evidence that economists believe we haven’t quite hit the right pace is that the Federal Reserve has pegged interest rates at zero and likely will keep them there until the middle of this year.But one of the first data points of 2015 may provide further evidence the economy is moving fast enough. The monthly report on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management was near a 3½-year high at about 59 for both October and November. December’s reading, due out Friday, also likely will look fairly strong.To put that number into perspective, only eight of the 73 readings during the last economic expansion ever got that high. More significantly, all came before September 2004 and so occurred in the first few years of the expansion rather than the last few. The economy kept expanding but needed no more artificial propulsion.The fact that ISM figures are high in the early part of expansions is natural. It is a diffusion index that asks whether a number of indicators are better, worse or the same than before. Improvement is tougher to come by after a while.The fact the index is so high today in month 67 of the expansion (the average postwar expansion has lasted only 59 months) suggests one of two things: Either the gravitational pull of the recession was unprecedented or we should have jettisoned the economic boosters already.
