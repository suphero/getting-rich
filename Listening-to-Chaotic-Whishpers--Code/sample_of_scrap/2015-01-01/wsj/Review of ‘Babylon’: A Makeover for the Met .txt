Review of ‘Babylon’: A Makeover for the Met If “Babylon” had been set in New York, there might have been outraged calls for its cancellation. A tawdry tapestry of craven politics, imbecilic law enforcement and media relations gone pear-shaped, it’s a rare kind of cop show—one that doesn’t glorify cops. Crimes are concealed; jurisprudence is hijacked; public safety is subordinate to public image. Given the real-world moment we’re living through, the show would have seemed like a shameless provocation, especially if all the characters had sounded like, say, Denis Leary.
