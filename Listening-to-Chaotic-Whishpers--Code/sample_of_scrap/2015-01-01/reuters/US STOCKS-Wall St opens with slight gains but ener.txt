US STOCKS-Wall St opens with slight gains but energy down again * Indexes up: Dow 0.2 pct, S&P 0.1 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct   (Updates to market open) NEW YORK, Dec 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were modestly higher on Wednesday, putting major indexes on track to end 2014 near record levels, though energy shares once again fell alongside crude oil prices. While the market’s seasonal trend of modest moves and low volume continued, there was heavier action in the energy space. Crude oil lost 2.6 percent, the fourth drop of at least 2 percent in the past five sessions, putting the commodity is at its lowest since May 2009.

Among the day’s biggest losers, Newfield Exploration fell 3.4 percent to $26.35 while Noble Corp was off 2.9 percent at $16.54. The broader move higher confirmed Wall Street’s recent upward bias. The S&P 500 has risen in seven of the past nine sessions, hitting a series of intraday and closing records. The stock market will be closed Thursday for the New Year’s holiday. “The trend isn’t broken and you need to go with it until it breaks,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio. “I don’t see anything coming up that could really break the fundamental picture out there. We could see pullbacks, which you should buy on, but I don’t see a downtrend.” NephroGenex Inc soared 265 percent to $17.25 a day after it said its lead drug was found to be safe in patients with diabetic nephropathy in a cardiac safety study.
