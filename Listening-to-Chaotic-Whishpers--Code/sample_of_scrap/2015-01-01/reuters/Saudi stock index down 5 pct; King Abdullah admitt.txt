Saudi stock index down 5 pct; King Abdullah admitted to hospital DUBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabiaâ€™s stock market fell sharply on Wednesday after Saudi state television reported that King Abdullah had been admitted to hospital for tests. The main equities index, which was down more than 1 percent earlier in the day in response to sliding oil prices, was 5.0 percent lower in the minutes after the television report, which quoted a brief royal court statement.
