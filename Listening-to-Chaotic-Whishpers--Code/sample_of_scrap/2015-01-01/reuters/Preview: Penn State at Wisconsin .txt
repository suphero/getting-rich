Preview: Penn State at Wisconsin In an era of players leaving college early for the riches of the NBA, two senior stars collide Wednesday as Penn State travels to fourth-ranked Wisconsin for the Big Ten opener for both teams. Penn State’s D.J. Newbill leads the conference in scoring with 21.4 points per game and is a savvy leader with 110 career starts. Wisconsin’s Frank Kaminsky, the Big Ten’s Preseason Player of the Year and reigning league Player of the Week, leads the Badgers with 16.5 points and 7.9 rebounds per contest. Penn State has won 10 in a row and at 12-1 is off to its best start in 19 years but faces its sternest challenge to date. The Badgers have won five in a row and also finished non-conference play at 12-1, with the only blemish a 10-point loss to second-ranked Duke.
