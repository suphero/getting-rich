Fitch Rates Abbey National North America's USCP programme 'F1' (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, December 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Abbey National North  America LLC's US CP programme a Short-term 'F1' rating. The programme and the  notes issued under the programme are unconditionally guaranteed by Santander UK  (rated A/Outlook Stable/F1). KEY RATING DRIVERS - CP RATINGS The programme rating reflects the unconditional guarantee given by Santander UK  to the CP programme and is in line with the bank's Short-term Issuer Default  Rating. The Short-term IDR is driven by the bank's standalone strength, as  assessed by its Viability Rating (VR), which in turn is underpinned by its  conservative risk appetite, strong market franchise, improving business  diversification, healthy asset quality and sound liquidity and capitalisation.  It also reflects the bank's moderate profitability and limited geographic  diversification, given its focus on the UK.

RATING SENSITIVIES - CP RATINGS The CP programme rating is sensitive to a change in the Short-term IDR of  Santander UK.
