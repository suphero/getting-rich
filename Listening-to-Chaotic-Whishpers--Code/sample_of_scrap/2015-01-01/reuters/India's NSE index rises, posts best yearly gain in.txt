The broader NSE index gained 31.4 percent in 2014, posting its best gain since 2009 in a year marked by a series of record highs. In dollar terms, the index was the second best performer in Asia after Shanghai, according to Thomson Reuters data. The benchmark BSE index closed 0.35 percent higher at 27,499.42.
