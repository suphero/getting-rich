Drink, don’t hold, fine wine Dec 31 (Reuters) – If you have a bottle of fine wine you are holding as an investment, you probably ought to open it tonight. That’s because, though wine has, at least on some measures, outperformed many other assets like art, stamps and bonds over the past 100 plus years, high transaction costs and volatility make a strong case for pleasure. Fine wines, held by about a quarter of global high-net worth individuals, have had a bad few years as an investment, with the Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 index down about 35 percent since June of 2011, hurt in part by an anti-corruption campaign in China. A cyclical bad patch isn’t the only argument for uncorking that first or – let’s be honest – third bottle of fine wine on New Year’s Eve; at least not on my reading of a paper on wine as an investment by Elroy Dimson of the University of Cambridge, Peter Rousseau of Vanderbilt University and Christophe Spaenjers of HEC Paris.
