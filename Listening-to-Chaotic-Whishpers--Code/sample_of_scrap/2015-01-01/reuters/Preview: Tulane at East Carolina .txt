Preview: Tulane at East Carolina Both teams look to begin their maiden voyage in the American Athletic Conference on a positive note when Tulane visits East Carolina on Wednesday afternoon. Tulane had won nine straight before dropping a 66-57 decision at No. 19 Washington and losing to No. 17 St. John’s 82-57 in New York. The Pirates, who spent last season in Conference USA along with Tulane, come in after winning consecutive games for the first time this season and three of their last four.
