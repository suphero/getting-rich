UPDATE 1-Qatar Airways flight makes unscheduled landing due to unruly passenger LONDON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - A Qatar Airways flight from New York was forced to make an unscheduled landing at a British airport due to a disruptive passenger, local police said on Thursday. “It would appear the staff had to restrain a male during the flight and the pilot had to re-route and land at Manchester. Police attended and have arrested the male,” a police spokesman said. The airport had earlier said the flight, which was headed to Doha, was diverted due to a minor medical issue.
