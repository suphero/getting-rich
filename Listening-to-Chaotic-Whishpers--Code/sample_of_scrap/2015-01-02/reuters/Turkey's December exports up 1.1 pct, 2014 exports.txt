Turkey's December exports up 1.1 pct, 2014 exports at record high ANKARA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Turkish December exports rose 1.1 percent year-on-year to $13.14 billion, the Turkish Exportersâ€™ Assembly (TIM) said on Thursday. Annual export figures for 2014 rose 4 percent to $157.62 billion, an all-time high, TIM said. TIM releases its figures almost a month before the state statistics office, and the two sets of data usually match.
