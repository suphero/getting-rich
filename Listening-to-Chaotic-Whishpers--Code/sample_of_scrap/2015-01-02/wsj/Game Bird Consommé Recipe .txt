Game Bird Consommé Recipe  1. Heat canola oil in a lidded 8-quart stock pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add chicken wings and squab and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 10-15 minutes. Add shallots, leeks, mushrooms and ginger, and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized, 5-10 minutes. Add spices and butter and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more 2. Add 2 cups Sherry and cook, uncovered, until reduced by ⅔, about 15 minutes. Add stock and bring to a boil, about 15 minutes. Adjust salt if necessary. Decrease heat and simmer gently, uncovered, occasionally skimming fat and impurities from surface, 1 hour. Strain and discard solids. Return broth to pot and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, make raft (optional): Whisk egg whites until frothy, 1-2 minutes. Stir in herbs and remaining Sherry. Whisk raft mixture into broth, then place back on stove over medium heat and simmer until egg whites float to surface, creating a raft, 15-20 minutes. Poke a small hole in egg whites to allow steam to escape, and gently simmer, uncovered, until crystal clear, 45 minutes more. Strain through muslin or cheesecloth into a clean container. Serve warm.
