Tom Sachs Brings His Boomboxes to Austin “It always starts with a party,” says Tom Sachs. In fact, the sculptor—known for a do-it-yourself punk style that often pokes fun at consumerist culture—made his first “boombox” for a Manhattan street party.It wasn’t his last. On Jan. 24, “Tom Sachs: Boombox Retrospective 1999-2015,” a selection of sculptures, will go on display at a Texas museum, The Contemporary Austin, and run through April 19.
