Four dead in Kentucky plane crash, girl, 7, survives: police (Reuters) - A small plane crashed in Kentucky late Friday, killing the pilot and three other passengers, while a seven-year-old girl apparently survived and wandered from the wreckage to find help, state police said. The plane went down in a heavily wooded area of Lyon County, about 115 miles northwest of Nashville, Kentucky State Police said. Authorities received a 911 call from a resident in the area who said a 7-year-old girl “had walked to his home reporting that she had been involved in a plane crash,” state police said in a statement posted on Facebook. “The juvenile was in distress and was transported to a local hospital for non-life threatening injuries,” the statement said. Rescue crews fanned out to look for the plane and discovered its wreckage in a wooded area, police said. Four people onboard were killed, among them the pilot, they said. Police said the Memphis Center of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed a distress call from a private aircraft in the vicinity of reported crash. The cause of the crash was under investigation. The identities of the victims were not yet known. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.
