Turkish leftist group claims responsibility for Istanbul police attack ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish far-left group DHKP-C has claimed responsibility for a grenade attack on police near the Turkish prime minister’s office in Istanbul. DHKP-C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front) was also behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy last year as well as attacks on Turkish police stations.  A man carrying an automatic weapon was detained on Thursday near the historic Dolmabahce Palace in Turkey’s largest city after he threw a grenade at police. In a statement posted on “The People’s Cry” website, the group said the attack over against the ruling AK Party over the killing of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan, who died in March last year after nine months in a coma from a head wound sustained during an anti-government protest. The DHKP-C also called Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan the perpetrator of Elvan’s death said it would hold his AK Party to account. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
