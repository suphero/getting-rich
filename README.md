# Getting Rich

## Key Notes

### Reproduce Stock Market Direction Random Forests

Paper results are possibly affected by data leakeage. Train data and test data may be overfit.

### Stock Prediction AI

Lots of missing codes & parts exists. Using FFT is problemmatic because it contains future data.
